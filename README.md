Search UX patterns

**User experience templates for search front ends and findability reporting dashboards**

The initial template can be viewed [here](http://bit.ly/results-mock-up-snapshot-feb-2016), as hosted on Dropbox.

At inception this repository is a single template for a search engine result page (SERP). Over time hopefully a library?

Tons of stuff is missing, including media assets. Bear with me as I learn myself the basics of GutHub.

Why?

When developing enterprise search solutions over the last 10 years, my experience has consistently been that features crucial to findability never make it into the actual services. With rotten findability(1) the entire content management solution loses its usefulness. This repository tries to address the problem by being a starting point for teams building enterprise search solutions, showing UX and findability best practices, with an emphasis on:

* Disambiguation through 1) Result groups and 2) Autocomplete topics
* Editorial maintenance
* User added results & sources
* User influenced relevancy & findability and
* Findability reporting

(1) Often 20% or worse in the «unstructed data behind the firewall» scenario
