Search UX patterns

**User experience templates for search front ends and findability reporting dashboards**

The initial template can be viewed [here](http://bit.ly/results-mock-up-snapshot-feb-2016), as hosted on Dropbox.

At inception this repository is a single template for a search engine result page (SERP). Over time hopefully a library?

Tons of stuff is missing, including media assets. Bear with me as I learn myself the basics of GutHub.
